"The discrepancy between college students' self-reported and perceived LLM usage and that of their friends can be explained by a number of plausible factors:

 Due to social desirability bias, students may underreport their own use of LLM in order to avoid being seen as technologically dependent or academically dishonest.  Students may wish to project an image of independence and competence because an excessive reliance on AI is stigmatized.
 In contrast, they may exaggerate their friends' use in an attempt to justify or normalize their own actions.  Mental defenses like ""everyone else is doing it"" are widespread.
 Absence of precise knowledge
 It's possible that students don't fully comprehend the frequency of LLM usage among their acquaintances.  Their reliance on anecdotal evidence, rumors, or assumptions may be erroneous.
It's possible that they only observe their peers utilizing LLMs in particular contexts, such as brainstorming or editing, and undervalue their application in other domains, like as writing or research.
 Various meanings of ""usage""
 It's possible that students will understand ""using"" an LLM differently.  While some may just think about direct text generation, others may also think about research, summarizing, or editing using LLMs.
 A student may overestimate a friend's use based on their perception of use, while underestimating their own use due to these disparate definitions.
